# Sprint Planning

Date/Time: 11/17

Participants: Malachi, Steve, Kalia, Mohamed

Goal Statement:  We will create a web application using the tools we have used this semester such as 
scrum, uml diagrams, flask and docker to create a d&d databank web application. This apllication will allow 
users register a login and enter charcater information. Malachi and Kalia will be the devoplers and Steve will be the scrum master. By working togeather will hopefully sucessefully create a D&D Character bank where we are able to run it and push it to guthub. 


# Daily Scrums

## 11/18

Participants: All

Notes
We all were trying to decide what to make. Steve had recently disccued trying to build a weather app 
where we can store weather data. However the app would have been to simple. So Malachi decide that we 
should do a d&d charcater databank where users can login and store characters and they can share the charcaters in the system. 
Steve decided that would be a a better opiton, Kalia and Moheaed agreed taht we liked teh idea. So all four of us decided to work on the project.

What did I do yesterday to help the team? 

Malachi, Steve: We started by talking about ideas we have for our team to build for our project

What will I do today to help the team?

Malachi: I will start by writing code and planing out the project for our charcater bank.

Do I see any impediment that prevents me
to make progress?

 Malachi, Steve, Kalia, Mohamed: We pretty were plannign things out and had 2 diifferent ideas on what to build but we agreed on what we should make.
# Daily Scrums

## 11/26

Participants: All

Notes
Malachi wanted to start on working on the devoplement for the application. He created the dev branch. Steve started writing the documention.
Kalia was also going to work on spme stuff with the project like UML Diagrams. After Malachi was going to be done withe code and implamenting the application we could pretty miuch get done with the user stories and the uml Diagrams so we can geta better understanding of how the code will work and how the data bank works. 

What did I do yesterday to help the team? 

Malachi: I Created the dev Branch and new repository. Started to also start with the coding. 

What will I do today to help the team?

Malachi: Guide them and tell them where I am at with the project

Do I see any impediment that prevents me
to make progress?

Steve And Mohamend: We could not get the code to run becasue teh dev branch was not on giuthub yet.

Notes

Problems:
Steve and Mohhamed were not able to run the code of the web application. They could not see the dev branch on github. And they were not able tor un it on docker.

How we fixed it: 
Steve call Malachi and found out that he create a new repository so Steve and Malachi worked togeather to get to to run on steve's docker. They did this by doing a clone, checkout dev and then opening docker to run the code. And it did work.

What we still need to do:

We still need to compelete other stuff like the testing as well as the chart. We will also finish the docmunettion before the the project is due. 
# Sprint Review

Date/Time: Dec 4th 

Participants: Malachi, Steve, Mohamed and Kalia

Notes....
Where we are at:
The project is almost done the project we were able to run the code. Pretty much Steve had to wrok on the documentation and Kalia had to finish some testing. Malachi was able to get it pushed to github. The web appliaction did run and it did function very well. The user could login and register. They were also able to add the character and the information like the class, race, power ect... The user could also seethe other users characters and was able to signout as well.
What needs to be done:
Malachi still need to fix a few things with the code and steve need to  get the notes done and the testing as well.  Kalia just needs to push a few things but pretty much were mostly done.


# Sprint Retrospective

Date/Time:  Dec 7

Participants: Malachi, Steve, Kalia and Mohamed

Notes



After doing this project had a things that went well and this that did not go well. But as a team we worked togeather to fix issues.

Isuess we had:

We were still trying to figure out what do for the project in the planning,
The code did not run properly on docker,
We were a bit behind with coding,
Had issues pushing to guthub,


Things that went well:



We were able to as a team work togeather,
Help eachother,
Stay in contact,
Malachi was able to fix the docker issue,
Kalia was able to help out with the testing,
Steve was abel to write teh notes


I would say overall as team we did a good job at making this project. Kalia and Malachi were very helpful in making the code. All memebers were also  were aslo willing to help eachother when we needed to do something that we were stuck on.
